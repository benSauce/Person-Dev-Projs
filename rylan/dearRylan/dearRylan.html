          I’m grateful for the short time we had together. From the start I felt that you were real with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for being considerate of me and my feelings and showing me this in many different ways (talking, physical comforts, i.e. food/drinks/activities).
          You brought me around your friends and family (to me that’s a big deal). You didn’t just tell me, you showed me your love.
        </p>
        <p>I want to let you know that meant a lot to me.</p>
        <p>
          I realize that our lives are currently on different paths. I have no doubt that if I stayed in Indy I would have asked you to be my girlfriend.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to let you know that even though I’m struggling, I’m finding real purpose out here. Something that I previously lacked.
        </p>

          I feel that I want to succeed not just for myself but for those around me. (I’m also working on loving myself because, honestly, I deserve it).
        </p>
        <p>
          When I take everyone and everything into consideration, it seems silly that I’ve sometimes been depressed or felt disconnected. I have many truly great people in my life.
           People that make me want to better myself. People that are there for me and I want to be there for.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past you have offered me your support. Just know that I’m here for you if you need anything.

          I still think about you daily. I apologize it took me so long to say any of this. I think I was always waiting for the "right time" to tell you how I felt.
          Also, I might've been afraid of hearing that it was the end of our time together. I try to meditate these days in general and one day it just clicked. There's no point in being afraid.
          I'm just grateful I got to share that time with you. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As always, hope all is well.
        </p>
