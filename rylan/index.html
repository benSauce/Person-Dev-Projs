    <p>
      	I’m very grateful for the short time we had together. From the get-go I felt that you were always honest and genuine with me. Thank for being considerate of me and my feelings and showing me this in many different ways (talking, physical comforts, i.e. food/drinks/activities). You brought me around your friends and family (to me that’s a big deal). You didn’t just tell me, you showed me your love. I want to let you know that meant a lot to me.
	I realize that our lives are currently on different paths. I have no doubt that if I stayed in Indy I would have asked you to be my girlfriend.
	I want to let you know that even though I’m struggling, I’m finding real purpose out here. Something that I previously lacked, unfortunately. I feel that I want to succeed not just for myself but for those around me. (I’m also working on loving myself because, honestly, I deserve it). When I take everyone and everything into consideration, it seems silly that I’m sometimes depressed or feel disconnected. I have many truly great people in my life. People that make me want to better myself. People that are there for me and I want to be there for.
	In the past you have offered me your support. Just know that I’m here for you also.
	I have to say that if there is any chance, I would love to pursue a relationship with you. I would regret it if I didn’t tell you.
	Maybe it’s in the cards, maybe it’s not but at least now it’s out and off my chest. Of course, I will respect your feelings and decisions.

Love,
Benja



	At times I hold back, I think I was afraid of being so open/vulnerable. Afraid to be seen in fear of rejection, fear of not being enough. I’m sorry for my hesitation.
	When you told me you loved me on the phone I replied, “You’re crazy.” I regret that. I think I was caught off guard because I felt that we hadn’t kept in touch much recently. But whenever I think of any of your actions or interactions with me, I feel you’ve always been true. So I want to apologize for the way I responded. The truth is I love you and that’s scary to me. But love has to worth the risk right, surely it is.
